      <h2>Longer Bio</h2>
      <p>
        I am a researcher and engineer working at the intersection of mechanical systems,
        applied mathematics, and data science. My current work explores how optimization and
        machine learning can improve engineering design and decision-making, especially in
        settings where experiments are expensive and uncertainty is unavoidable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond research, I care deeply about teaching and mentoring. I enjoy helping students
        move from theory to implementation by building clear, reproducible workflows and
        computational intuition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside academics, I am a husband and father, and I value the perspective and balance
        that family brings to my work.
